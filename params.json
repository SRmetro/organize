{"name":"Spring Uprising, March 18th-21st 2015","tagline":"NYC Metro Area Organizing ","body":"# Spring Rising 2015: An Anti-war Intervention in DC\r\n\r\n## NYC Metro Area Contingent \r\n\r\nYou are needed in Washington DC, from March 18th - 21st. Why? Because the United States government thinks you support endless war.\r\n\r\nWe have been told the anti-war movement is dead. We have been told that the Global War on Terror (TM) has made us safer. After trillions of dollars spent, thousands upon thousands of lives lost, we are being told every day that the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have brought freedom and democracy to these countries. We have been told by some that we have \"withdrawn\" our global presence in places of conflict, that although bombs continue to fall and boots continue on the ground, we are not actually at war.  \r\n\r\nIf you believe this, then no need to read further. But if you know the truth, come with us to the heart of the empire, where we will show the world that so many Americans reject the havoc our government has wrought on other nations. So many Americans believe in peace.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this website is to provide information about the upcoming Spring Rising event, and a background on the issues it will focus on. I hope to justify, using links and background information about US policy, why a peaceful, radical intervention is needed now more than ever. I hope to provide kindling for the fire that lights the hearts of peaceful crusaders and activists in the metro area, and to rekindle the hearts of those that would appreciate a reminder of why these issues are important.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with the aide of other great area organizers, we are working to book buses that will provide transportation for the last two days of the intervention. Activists from all around the metro area will attend the Friday teach-in, \"Ending Current Wars, Ending the Institution of War,\" and the Saturday rally and march.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Uprising, please see the [event's homepage](http://cindysheehanssoapbox.com/spring-rising-an-anti-war-intervention-in-dc.html) and [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/430232700485435). Please note that it starts on March 18th. \r\n\r\nTo contact me about organizing in NYC, upstate, New Jersey, or Connecticut, please send a message to springrisingnyc@gmail.com. In particular, let me know if you want to come on the bus! The sooner I can get an idea of attendance, the sooner I will be able to reserve a bus or buses! If we can fill a 52 person bus, tickets will likely cost 20-40 dollars.\r\n\r\nHere is the tentative schedule of \r\n\r\n# Endless War, as seen in 2015\r\n\r\nWe all know there are reasons why endless war is bad for America, but how can we express this to our friends, family, and fellow citizens? I think the best answer is to present them with information, for nothing is more convincing than the facts. Below is a primer on topics that will be covered during the intervention. I believe that US war policy affects a very wide range of social justice issues, and that there's a good reason for everyone interested in social justice causes to care about what's being done in our name. Please feel free to explore the below links, which reference the work of awesome journalists and activists. Please share widely!\r\n\r\n## Drones\r\n\r\nThousands of people, more than died on 9/11, have been killed by unmanned drones in the covert US drone war. Drone strikes have hit Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Afghanistan. Were the targets all terrorists? The Obama administration admitted a long time ago that [it doesn't know who it's killing](http://www.propublica.org/article/dissecting-obamas-standard-on-drone-strike-deaths). The administration classifies any \"military aged male\" as a fair target, innocent or guilty, as the New York Times [reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&pagewanted=all&#p%5BTMATMA%5D) in 2012. (Not exactly a bastion of anti-war sentiment, right?) Information regarding those killed in drone strikes has been difficult to ascertain, but a few good sources are the excellent [website of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/) which is dedicated to tracking drone strikes and those killed by them, Robert Greenwald's film [Unmanned: America's Drone Wars](http://unmanned.warcosts.com/), which can be streamed online for free, Pitch Interactive's [unique visualisation of drone strikes in Pakistan](http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/), Democracy Now's [collection of broadcasts on the drone war](http://www.democracynow.org/topics/drone_attacks), the exhaustively researched joint [Stanford-NYU report on the counterproductive impact of drone strikes](http://www.livingunderdrones.org/), and the activist blog [Know Drones](http://www.knowdrones.com/).\r\n\r\nAll of these sources provide evidence that hundreds of innocent people have died from drone strikes, without ever being convicted or even suspected of being terrorists. Thousands more have died without any idea of who they were, if they meant our country harm, or what they might have been guilty of. For those that have not died, the psychological effects of the constant presence of drones in their communities, many of which fly over towns without striking a target, is long-lasting and devistating. Additionally, soldiers and federal agents who participate in drone strikes have reported psychological trauma as a result of their participation in this covert war. For information about the impact on Americans, see [Brandon Bryant's Democracy Now interview](http://www.democracynow.org/2013/10/25/a_drone_warriors_torment_ex_air), and this [article by Live Science](http://www.livescience.com/40959-military-drone-war-psychology.html). For information about the psychological impacts of the residents of the countries America bombs, see [this psychologist in the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-jay-lifton/10-reflections-drones_b_3062566.html), this [report by Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dangerous-ideas/201408/predators-reapers-and-psychology-s-do-no-harm-ethics), and this [report in the Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/drones-dont-just-kill-their-psychological-effects-are-creating-enemies/article9707992/). \r\n\r\nMany of the above writings note that the use of drone warfare under the Obama administration has become normalized and routine. Some see drones as a \"humane\" way of killing those perceived to be our enemies, as a \"safer\" way to wage war than convential ground troops. Some think that the impact on American lives and the standing of our country internationally has been minimal. \r\n\r\nDo you agree? If not, you should come with us to DC.\r\n\r\n## ISIS and military action related\r\n\r\nThere is widespread consensus among those who stay awake in the American policy world, those not beholden to the propaganda machine of the mainstream media outlets in this country that ISIS, a brutal terrorist organization also known as Daesh or the Islamic state, would not exist at all except as a product of the aftermath of the US invasion in Iraq. The American media is obsessed with ISIS because it thinks this horrifying group, who has sought as much media attention as possible by staging high-profile hostage killings, arose out of nowhere. Many reasonable voices have proven this absurd notion wrong (see below). The US is actively [at war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Inherent_Resolve) with ISIS in both Iraq and Syria. Though media outlets and pundits bicker over whether there are \"troops on the ground\" or even if we're technically at war, the administration has [already admitted](http://time.com/3341270/isis-war-obama-iraq-terrorism-isil/) that there is no end in sight to the conflict with ISIS.\r\n\r\nThus far, it is arguable that ISIS has been the most impactful and terrifying legacy of the US invasion in 2003. For many resources regarding the origins of this group as a result of previous warmaking, see:\r\n\r\n* [Jeremy Scahill on Democracy Now](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/10/3/jeremy_scahill_on_obamas_orwellian_war)\r\n* [Patrick Cockburn on Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/how-us-helped-isis-grow-monster-iraq-syria-assad) \r\n* [Ben Reynolds on the Diplomat](http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/iran-didnt-create-isis-we-did/)\r\n* [David Miliband concedes with humility](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iraq-war-created-isis-concedes-david-miliband-1460557)\r\n* [Nafeez Ahmed on Mint Press News](http://www.mintpressnews.com/west-created-isis/196488/)\r\n* [Tariq Ali and Patrick Cockburn on Counterpunch](http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/09/29/the-rise-of-isis-and-the-origins-of-the-new-middle-east-war/) and [Mike Whitney on Counterpunch](http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/10/06/americas-terrorist-academy-in-iraq-produced-isis-leaders/)\r\n* [Juan Cole on Informed Comment](http://www.juancole.com/2014/12/ceased-exist-again.html)\r\n\r\nDo the American people want yet another open ended military conflict in the Middle East? Is anyone in US government thinking about the future consequences of this war? You tell us.    \r\n\r\n## Dirty Wars\r\n\r\nThe US military presence in the world is not limited to missions from the DOD, or even covert missions from the CIA. Journalist Jeremy Scahill introduced the public to the [Dirty Wars](http://dirtywars.org/) that we're involved in, all over the world. These operations are so secretive, that even the majority of the military does not know about them. Should the executive branch have it's own private army, that wages warfare on top of all the other operations the government undertakes? \r\n\r\n## Police Militarization\r\n\r\nThe civil rights uprising against police brutality in Ferguson, MO and elsewhere has rejuvenated attention on the militarization of the police. In order to maintain the profitability of the war machine, war equipment and weaponry is increasingly [sold to police departments](http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150112/news/150119745/). We are told that police departments in possession of assault weapons and armored tanks will make our communities safer. Considering the damage this equipment has caused abroad, do we really believe it will help our communities at home? Many notable scholars have spoken about the relation of the Global War on Terror to the increased militarization of the police. See for example [Angela Davis, just last month](http://www.essence.com/2015/02/04/angela-davis-talks-racist-police-killings-mlk-convocation/), [Richard Wood on Counterpunch](http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/01/30/police-brutality-colonial-violence-and-the-war-on-terror/), and [Kevin Gosztola on Firedoglake](http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/tag/police-militarization/), who writes frequently on the impact of US foreign policy on our domestic rights as Americans.\r\n\r\n## Surveillance \r\n\r\nThe [disclosures of Edward Snowden in 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_%282013%E2%80%93present%29) revolutionized the way the that the public sees secretive intelligence agencies like the NSA. Far from protecting the public, these agencies have turned the entire internet into a giant surveillance machine, ostensibly to \"catch terrorists.\" The data of thousands, if not millions of innocent people is collected and stored for unknown purposes. With so much data collected, intelligence that could actually protect the country is lost. Further, innocent people all over the world are watched, the private information about their lives cataloged for the government to use for unknown purposes. Does this make the world safer? \r\n\r\n## Support of proxy wars, totalitarian regimes\r\n\r\n## Military Spending, War and the economy  \r\n\r\n## Veteran suicides\r\n\r\n## Persecution of Veterans that speak out against Endless War \r\n\r\n## War and Climate Change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
